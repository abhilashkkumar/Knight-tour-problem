This solution works on Warnsdorffâ€™s algorithm, which uses a heuristic function to
determine the next move.

This solution can be extended furter for NxN. in order to do this change the size of board in "board.rb"

This solution tries to find out the path for upto 100 tries

how to run =>  ruby main.rb 0 0

0 0 represents the x and y (initial spot) respectively 

output => print the full board containing the path with number (if solution exist under 100 tries)
